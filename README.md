# Pythagorean

A simple project to see the equation of a Pythagorean.
Visit https://chr3st5an.github.io/Pythagorean/ to do so.
This repo also includes a python file which implemented 
a Pythagorean as class. 

```py
a = Pythagorean(11)
print(a)  # Shows the equation
print(a.triads)  # Represents the triads of the Pythagorean
print(int(a))  # The result of the equation
print(3 in a)  # Same as '3 in a.triads'
print(a[0])  # Same as 'a.triads[0]'
```
